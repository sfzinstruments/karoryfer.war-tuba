War Tuba is a sample library for Plogue Sforzando version 1.845 or newer. It contains samples of a tuba played by Jakub Lewicki (aka Ignacy Woland of the band Hañba!), recorded and mapped by Drogomir Smolken.

To register the Sforzando bank, drag the War_Tuba.bank.xml file onto the Sforzando interface. Once registered, the instrument will be available in the Sforzando loading menu and the GUI will work.

Only one tuba is sampled - the duo and trio instruments use the same samples transposed to create the additional voices. Except for the Tubaborg synth, the instruments all use the same keyswitches to control articulations - staccatissimo, staccato and sustain. Dynamics for staccato, staccatissimo (as well as valve noises for the solo instruments) are controlled by velocity. Dynamics for sustained notes (as well as breath and yell effects) are controlled by MIDI CC 1.
